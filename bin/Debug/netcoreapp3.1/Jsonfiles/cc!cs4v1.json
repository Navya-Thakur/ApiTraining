We recommend using a headset or a set of quality speakers. You will then be asked a series of questions about each of the calls. </br></br>You should enter the information that the caller gives in the appropriate boxes on the computer screen. For example, you should enter the caller's first name, last name, street address, city, and/or telephone number in the boxes marked for that information. You should enter any vehicle identification number, License Plate, or Driver's License provided by the caller in the boxes marked for that information. </br></br>You may write notes about the calls in the box in the lower half of the screen labeled Notes to help you recall information about the call.</br></br>The information you record in any of the boxes on the screen will later be available to assist you in choosing the correct answer.</br></br>After each call is completed, follow the on-screen instructions to proceed to the questions about that call. </br></br>You will also need to respond to any emergency messages that appear in the bottom right corner of the screen by left clicking your mouse over the agency to be dispatched. Failing to respond to a decision-making message within 15 seconds after the message first appears will result in a lower score.</br></br>HOW TO RESPOND TO MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTION </br></br>With each question there will be four choices labeled A, B, C, and D. You can choose your response in one of three ways.</br></br>1. You can use your mouse to select your answers</br></br>2. You can use the up and down arrows to choose your response.</br></br>3. You can hold down the Alt key and then press either A, B, C, or D.</br><p class='aria-only'>Press Alt+s to pause the background audio while accessing Emergency box.
