Do NOT use abbreviations in this section of the test.<br/><br/>    Be sure to enter data in the correct boxes. The order in which you are given data will frequently change. For example, sometimes you will be given the phone number before you are given the name or address.<br/><br/>    You will be informed when each set of data you hear is completed. You should then follow the on-screen instructions and enter the new data you hear. Continue this process until the time limit runs out.<br/><br/>    You will also need to respond to any emergency messages that appear in the bottom right corner of the screen by left clicking your mouse over the agency to be dispatched. Failing to respond to a decision-making message within 15 seconds after the message first appears will result in a lower score.<br/>    ",
