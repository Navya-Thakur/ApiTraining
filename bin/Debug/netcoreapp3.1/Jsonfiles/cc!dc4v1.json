Using the reference list of names, addresses, and telephone numbers on the right side of the screen, enter the correct information about a person as requested by the computer. Like a telephone book, names are listed in alphabetical order according to people's last names. For example, if the directory lists a person's name as \"Smith, Adam\" then their first name is \"Adam\" and their last name is \"Smith.\" You might have to use the scroll bar on the right side of the list to view the entire list. <br/><br/> You will be asked questions about the directory and you should enter the requested information into the box provided on the screen. <br/><br/>In the questions, names are always given with the first name first. For example, if you see the question, \"What is the telephone number of John Smith,\" then John is the first name and Smith is the last name. <br/><br/>Enter names by first, then last name. Data entered will be scored for accuracy. <br/><br/>You will also need to respond to any emergency messages that appear in the bottom right corner of the screen by left clicking your mouse over the agency to be dispatched. Failing to respond to a decision-making message within 15 seconds after the message first appears will result in a lower score.<p class='aria-only'>Press Alt+s to pause the background audio while accessing Emergency box. Press Alt+r to resume the background audio.</p>",
