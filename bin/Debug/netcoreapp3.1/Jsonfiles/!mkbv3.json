      "referenceText": "This 77-year-old patient was referred to us from the stress laboratory because of an exercise-induced second-degree heart block.  Because of this, his atenolol was reduced to 25 mg q.d. This had been prescribed for his chronic hypertension.  The patient's symptoms are mainly those of dyspnea, which are quite severe.  Even bending over and tying his shoelaces makes him extremely short of breath.  This level of exhaustion has been problematic for the patient for some time now.  Under examination, the patient exercised on a treadmill.  His heart rate at rest was 53 and while exercising the patient's heart rate was 64.  At this point, he developed second degree, Mobitz type II AV block and transient complete heart block.  The patient was again exercised in the office.  His heart rate was only 48 while exercising.  The patient could only exercise for 1 minute and 51 seconds.  He denies any syncope or angina.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes primary hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto's goiter.  He has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the vocal cords, which was treated with 6,600 rads in November of 1995.  There is also a history of a right colectomy for colon cancer, a benign essential tumor, and a history of shingles in 1996.  The patient suffers from chronic hypertension.\n\nThe patient is allergic to penicillin, which causes facial hives and swelling in the face and neck regions.  Current medications include (1) atenolol, 25 mg q.d., (2) enteric-coated aspirin, and (3) Levothroid, 0.15 mg.  The patient was recently widowed and lives by himself.  He does not drink, but does have a history of smoking.  The patient states that he has not smoked in the past seven years.\n\nA closer examination revealed that the patient has a blood pressure of 150/90.  Although in no acute distress, the patient appears overly anxious and excited.  His lungs are clear, but he suffers from sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 48 per minute.  There are no cannon waves in the neck, nor are there any heart murmurs or gallops.  Aside from a colectomy scar, the abdomen and all extremities appear to be normal.\n\nWhen exercised, the patient's heart rate increased only to 48, yet he was extremely short of breath.  Along with his history of hypertension, the transient exercise induced complete heart block causing his dyspnea, making even mild exercise an extreme threat to the patient's over-all health and well being.  For now, his atenolol has been stopped.  At the moment, it is strongly recommended that the patient receive a permanent pacemaker, but the patient is reluctant to do so at this time.  His atenolol will be changed to lisinopril 10 mg q.d. to control his hypertension.  The patient had planned on taking an extensive out of town vacation, but he has been asked to cancel those plans for now.  Permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered following further tests.\n\nThe patient's current symptoms are similar to an earlier coronary event suffered by the patient, which led to bypass surgery in 1992.  He was in his usual state of health until one morning when he awoke abruptly with midsternal chest pain.  This pain was associated with mild dyspnea, but not diaphoresis, did not radiate, but he did have some tingling in the fingers of his left hand.  The pain was vaguely reminiscent of an even earlier incident of chest pain with coronary disease.  He stated that the pain persisted all morning.  Finally, he called the hospital and was advised to come in to the emergency room for evaluation.  He stated that on his drive to the hospital that he did have some additional chest pain, although he was free of pain for most of the time."
