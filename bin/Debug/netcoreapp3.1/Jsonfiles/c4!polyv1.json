For this test, you will need to listen to information that is provided to you through the headset you have been provided.  Make sure you have your headset on now and can hear these instructions. <br/><br/>During this test you will be shown a company’s policy and procedures regarding callers’ issues.  After reading the policy, you should click on the \"Listen to Caller\" button to hear the telephone call.  After the call is completed, you will be presented with a statement regarding the call.  You will then need to choose whether the statement is \"true\", \"false\", or you \"need more information from the caller to make this determination. <br/><br/>You will be able to read the policy before the call starts.  When you feel you are ready to hear the call please click the button \"Listen to Caller\".  Once you have played the call you may not repeat it. <br/><br/>After you have finished the question, click the \"Submit Answer\" button that will appear at the bottom of the page to listen to the next call. <br/><br/> You do not need to enter any customer information during this test.  You are only required to evaluate whether a company’s policy applies to each caller’s issue. <br/><br/>Good luck!",
