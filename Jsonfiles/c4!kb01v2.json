      "referenceText": "The ability to communicate is one of the most important gifts that people possess. A powerful and eloquent communicator is able to champion a cause, inspire legions, and command nations. But what of those people whose communication is stymied by a physical disability, such as blindness or deafness? How can they communicate with others? Throughout the history of many different cultures, people with blindness and deafness have developed language techniques that allow them to express abstract thoughts and ideas. These seemingly simple innovations have enriched the lives of literally millions of people by allowing them to share what is most important to them: their thoughts.\n\nThis history of visual communication for the deaf in western societies is long and evolving. In the early 19th century, a group of men in Hartford, Connecticut, became interested in establishing a formal school for the deaf, but at the time there was no formal codified language for deaf people to use. This conundrum led the men to research far and wide the many visual language \"dialects\" that were popping up in various cities and countries. American Sign Language itself is a blend of these various dialects, along with some symbols from an early French sign language system.\n\nIn 1817, the first permanent school for the deaf was finally established in the city of Hartford. Creating a method of instruction for deaf children proved challenging because none of the children used the same method of signing. One of the new schools instructors, Dr. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet (a graduate of Yale University), was sent to England in order to study methods of instruction there. While in London, Dr. Gallaudet met the Abbe Sicard, who invited him to visit his school in France, which had been established in 1755. After months of study, Dr. Gallaudet returned to the States with a wealth of knowledge and instruction.\n\nLike oral communication, written communication is a powerful tool. Whereas deaf people had to adapt to visual communication in order to converse, persons with visual impairments required some means of reading and comprehending written material. This proved to be most challenging, as many letters in the alphabet are virtually indistinguishable when read by touch.\n\nAlthough some forms of written relief systems (writing systems that relied on touch, not sight, to read) had been developed as early as the 18th century, these systems were quite crude and were not widely adopted. It was at about the same time that Dr. Gallaudet was studying and helping to develop sign language for the deaf that Louis Braille began looking for ways to improve written relief systems so that they were more easily read.\n\nOne system that had already been developed by Charles Barbier appeared to be very promising to Braille. Braille was impressed by Barbiers system, because rather than trying to imitate alphabetic characters, it instead used a series of dots, which were much easier to interpret by touch. Braille studied the system extensively, and eventually improved on it by further simplifying the number of dots used in the characters. By 1834, Braille had largely completed the system that now bears his name. Although it has had some revisions (and competitors) throughout the years, the Braille system is by far the largest and most widely accepted written relief language. Its application has even extended beyond its original purpose of providing a form of written communication for the visually impaired. The American military has used Braille as a way of reading communication in war zones (without the fear of lights alerting an enemy to a squads position).\n\nA footnote to the history of Braille is the American Modified Braille system, which was never accepted by British Braille authorities. This enhanced version was developed in 1878 and featured the advantage of using fewer dots for characters that were more frequently used. Several such improvements were adapted in other varieties of Braille, but Braille authorities in different countries, and even different schools, never could reach consensus. As such, Louis Brailles system of written relief has survived mostly intact for over 150 years.\n\nToday, doctors and scientists are making great strides in improving conditions for the deaf and visually impaired. Many diseases that once caused blindness or deafness are now easy to diagnose and treat before the patient loses either of these vital senses. For people whose blindness or deafness is permanent, many inventions have been developed that help these people to live vibrant and normal lives. Such innovations as the TDD machine and Seeing Eye dogs give the deaf and visually impaired ways to communicate and mobilize like never before."
