This is a test of your ability to use information from a list. Using the reference list of names, addresses, and telephone numbers shown on the right side of the screen, you should enter the correct information about the person as requested.  Like a telephone book, names are listed in alphabetical order according to the person's last name.  For example, if the directory lists a person's name as \"Smith, Adam\" then their first name is \"Adam\" and their last name is \"Smith\".  You might have to use the scroll bar on the right side of the list to view the entire list. <br/><br/>You will be asked questions about the directory and you should enter the requested information into the box provided on the screen. <br/><br/>In the questions, names are always given with the first name first.  For example, if you see a question, \"What is the telephone number of John Smith\", then John is the first name and Smith is the last name. <br/><br/>When responding to requests for names, you should enter names by first, then last name (such as John Smith). The data you enter will be scored for accuracy. <br/><br/>Good luck!",
