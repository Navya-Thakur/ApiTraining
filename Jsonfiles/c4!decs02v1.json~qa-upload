For this test, you will need to listen to information that is provided to you through the computer. We recommend using a headset or a set of quality speakers. </span><br /> <br /> During this test you should listen to each telephone call and enter the caller’s data into the proper fields on the screen as it is given.  You can use the mouse to go to any field in the data-entry table.  You can also use the 'Tab' or 'Enter' keys to move to the next field, and the 'Shift'-'Tab' combination to go back to the previous field.  Please note that the data presented during this test may not be in the same order as the fields on the screen.  For example, sometimes you will be given the phone number before you are given the caller’s name or address. <br /> <br />You do not need to enter the hyphens ( - ) for telephone numbers.  The hyphens have already been entered for you. <br /> <br />After each call is completed, you will be presented with a question asking you to summarize the call you just heard.  For this task, you should choose the response that best represents the caller’s issue presented in the call. <br /> <br /> After you have finished the question, click the 'Submit Answer' button that will appear at the bottom of the page to listen to the next call.  <br /> <br /> Finally, during this test the computer will automatically enter data in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  There is no need for you to adjust your keyboard since this will be done automatically.  <br /> <br /> Please note, although you may hear state names during the call, do not enter the state names, or state abbreviations, during this test.  <br /> <br /> Good luck!
