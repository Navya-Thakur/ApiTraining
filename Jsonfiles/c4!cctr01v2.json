For this test, you will need to listen to information that is provided to you through the computer. We recommend using a headset or a set of quality speakers.<br /><br />During this test you will play the role of a customer service agent who is responding to telephone calls for service.  To do this you must first answer the call and enter the caller’s name and telephone number.  When the \"Incoming Call\" button begins flashing and you hear the telephone ringing, click on the button to answer the call.  After the customer provides you with their name and telephone number and you have entered that information in the appropriate fields, click the \"Run Search\" button.<br /><br />Once you have brought up the customer information and at various points throughout the test, you will be presented with three different ways you, as the customer service agent, might respond to the caller.  At those times, you will be asked to select the \"<b>Most effective</b>\" and \"<b>Least effective</b>\" response of the three choices.  Each choice will be presented in a written format and will also have an audio version for you to listen to.  You can listen to the response by clicking on the \"Play Audio\" button next to each response.<br /><br />The \"<b>Most effective</b>\" response is the one which, in general, is most likely to create a good impression of the customer service agent to the caller in terms of communication, politeness, interpersonal interaction, demonstrating sound judgment, and effectively addressing the caller’s issues.<br /><br />The \"<b>Least effective</b>\" response one which, in general, is most likely to create a poor impression of the customer service agent to the caller.<br /><br />If there appears to be more than one most effective or least effective response, then please do your best to choose between them to indicate the very most effective or very least effective response.<br /><br />Please choose one \"<b>Most effective</b>\" response and one \"<b>Least effective</b>\" response by clicking on the appropriate radio buttons.<br /><br />Finally, at any time during this test you may click on the \"Repeat caller’s last statement\" button if you wish to hear the caller’s last comment again.<br /><br />Good luck!",
