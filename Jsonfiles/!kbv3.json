      "referenceText": "Congratulations Mrs. Selvie Mirgenstrein,\n\nYou have been randomly chosen from a pool of 919 people as a grand prize winner. This selection awards several magnificent prizes and we, here at Lenceber Used Autos (LUA), are pleased to have chosen you, Selvie Mirgenstrein, as our prize package recipient. All those who purchased an automobile from our Sremercer Lot last February-December were entered in the annual drawing. Your patronage entitled a one-quarter inch square slip of paper with your name on it to be placed in the fish tank on the showroom floor. \n\nHere at LUA we value our customers and try in every way possible to enrich their lives and help them have the most pleasant car buying experience possible. While each and every customer is equally valuable and important to our staff,  we can only offer such a marvelous prize to one lucky customer. What a lucky day when we picked your name! Aren't you glad you decided to buy from LUA? In order to claim your prize you will need to come to Sremercer Lot anytime Monday-Friday. Please bring with you the following materials: 1) this letter indicating that you have won the grand prize, 2) a Driver's License, State Issued Identification Card or other form of identification (Social Security Cards are not acceptable forms of identification), and 3) your sense of fun, because you will be having a lot soon! \n\nLUA's prize package includes a gift basket of car care products, a coupon book, and a trip to Hollywood, California. LUA's gift basket contains bottles of window cleaner, car wash, car wax, tire cleaner, and Bill's Car Protectant. To further aid in your car's maintenance, we've added a 12-pack of lint-free rags, a chamois, 3 absorbent sponges, and a CD-ROM containing car maintenance tips. All of the products are bundled in an attractive bucket--perfect to use when you next wash your automobile. The coupon book contains complimentary tire rotations, oil changes, fluid checks, and safety inspections from LUA's on-site service department. But that's not all! Other coupons let you enjoy your community with free movie admission passes, Pelier Playhouse vouchers, and tickets to the next Mercantile Dance Company's production of Dill Horseradish. Hopefully you won't be too busy caring for the car or enjoying the coupons to get away to sunny Hollywood, CA. LUA will treat you right by paying for round-trip airfare, five-night hotel stay, and 3 meals a day for you and a guest. You'll be flying on Atlanta-Pacific Airlines (APA) and staying at the luxurious, world famous Miridian Hotel of Hollywood. You and your guest may dine where you please for the six days, as long as you stay within the per diem meal allowance of $100. You will receive more details concerning your trip when you come to claim your prize and also at the time of trip departure to Hollywood, CA, known as being the historical center for movie studios and movie stars alike. \n \nIf you have any questions or concerns, or if you are unable to come in to claim your prize during the times listed you may email us at Lillien@LenceberUsedAutos.com or phone our receptionist us at 277-568-2804 and ask for Lillien, and we will make sure that all of the great prizes get to you. We look forward to hearing from you soon so that we may arrange your exciting trip to Hollywood and allow you to begin using all of the products and coupons that we are pleased to offer as a \"Thank You\" for being one of our very valued customers. \n\nAgain congratulations, \n\nEriqe Lirlins"
