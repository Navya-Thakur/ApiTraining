For this test, you will need to listen to information that is provided to you through the computer. We recommend using a headset or a set of quality speakers.<br/><br/>During this test you should listen to each telephone order message and enter the data into the proper fields on the screen as it is given.  After each order is completed, click the \"Next\" button at the top left corner to listen to the next order.  If you do not click on the button to hear the next order within five (5) seconds after completing the previous order, the audio from the next order will automatically begin.<br/><br/>You can use the mouse to go to any field in the order-form table.  You can also use the \"Tab\" or \"Enter\" keys to move to the next field, and the \"Shift\"-\"Tab\" combination to go back to the previous field.  Please note that the data presented during this test may not be in the same order as the fields on the screen.  For example, sometimes you will be given the phone number before you are given the callerâ€™s name or address.<br/><br/>You should continue to enter information until the test stops. <br/><br/>You do not need to enter the hyphen ( - ) for telephone numbers.  The hyphen has already been entered for you.<br/><br/>Finally, during this test the computer will automatically enter data in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  There is no need for you to adjust your keyboard since this will be done automatically. <p class='aria-only'>Press Alt+s to pause the background audio. Press Alt+r to resume the background audio.</p><br/><br/>Good luck!",
