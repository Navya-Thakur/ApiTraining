      "referenceText": "Many managers complain about the amount of time that they must spend in meetings. A number of research studies show that managers spend a major portion of their time in face-to-face meetings or in telephone meetings. The amount of time spent, however, is not the key issue. If a meeting produces good results, few individuals will question how long the meeting lasted. The problem is that too much time is wasted on trivia. \n\nWhat happens prior to a meeting often determines the success of that meeting. A good strategy is to plan the agenda carefully and allocate a precise amount of time for each topic. Then the appropriate people must be invited to participate in the meeting. Each person should know exactly what will be discussed and what he or she is expected to contribute to the meeting. Too often time is wasted in meetings because some or all of the participants did not prepare for the meeting properly.\n\nTime must also be utilized wisely during meetings. The time needed to present an issue and to discuss that issue must be balanced delicately. A good leader understands the dynamics of the group and makes sure that each participant has an opportunity to be heard during the meeting and that one or two people do not take over and dominate the meeting. Drawing out the quiet, shy person may be far easier to accomplish than trying to control the outspoken person who monopolizes a meeting.\n\nMost employers are extremely concerned about the health of their workers for several reasons. Workers who are in poor health are much more likely to be absent from work than workers who are in good health. Employee absenteeism is very costly. Often temporary workers have to be hired to replace absent workers. In addition, medical costs are rising at a very rapid pace. In fact, medical costs are rising faster than any of the other benefits given to workers.\n\nWorkers can do a great deal to improve their own health. One of the ways workers can improve their health is to avoid or to get rid of bad habits such as smoking, drinking in excess, or using drugs. Many organizations offer programs to help employees quit smoking. They also offer employee assistance programs to help employees with drug and alcohol problems. In the final analysis, however, it is the worker who must assume the responsibility for his or her actions.\n\nWorkers can also improve their health by eating the right food and by exercising regularly. Most people eat far too much food that is high in cholesterol and not nearly enough food that is high in fiber content. The exercise program needed for good health does not have to be a drastic one such as jogging. Walking at a fast pace for at least thirty minutes three times a week is quite satisfactory. Other types of good exercise include riding a bicycle and swimming.\n\nMost organizations are quite anxious to improve their productivity. The employee, the system or manner in which the work is accomplished, and the tools that are used to do the work are the three key factors in improving productivity. The employee is the most critical component of a system. The employee not only must be capable of doing the job, but he or she also must be willing and motivated to assume responsibility for doing the job right. Quality is often far more important than the quantity of work done.\n\nTime management and work simplification are key concepts in ensuring that work is performed efficiently and effectively. Learning to set priorities and to do work in accordance with the priorities set is extremely important. Most people do not spend enough time on the planning stage of the job. Often, they plan the job at the same time they are trying to do the job. Careful planning prevents poor performance and saves time in the long run. Try to think of planning as an investment rather than an expenditure of time.\n\nTools are also quite important. Computers and good software can reduce and, in some cases, even eliminate a great deal of the routine work that has to be done in an office. Many companies have invested heavily in electronic office systems, but they just have not had dramatic increases in productivity. Buying the tools is not the only step. All of the employees must be able to use the tools maximally if the productivity of the company is to be increased."
