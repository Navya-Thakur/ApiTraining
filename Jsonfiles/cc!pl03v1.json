  "instruction": "<span role=heading aria-level=3> Position Locating (Written)</span><br><br>You are about to begin the \"Position Locating\" test.  At the beginning, you will see a map comprising the majority of the screen.  This map will be used to answer the simulated calls that are displayed on the right-hand side of the screen.  The simulated calls will describe certain items that appear on the map.  Using the information provided, you are to determine the most-likely location of the caller on the map.  <br><br>The map is divided into a grid by columns and rows.  Use the two drop down boxes to select the appropriate answer.  In the first drop down box, select a letter relating to a column on the map.  In the second drop down box you will select a number relating the a row on the map.  The intersection of the column and row is what you consider to be the most-likely location of the caller.<br><br>Once you have selected a column and a row from the drop down boxes, you can proceed to the next question using the \"Next\" button.  If you wish to review previous questions use the \"Back\" button.  You can also skip an unanswered question by clicking the \"Next\" button.  You may return to unanswered questions later in the test.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                           <br>If a time limit has been set for this test by the test administrator, you will see the timer counting down in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.  This timer shows how much time you have remaining to complete the test.  If no time limit has been set, there will be no visible timer.<br><br>Across the top of the screen you will see a toolbar.  This toolbar lists the total number of questions and the number of unanswered questions remaining.  It also contains a drop down list of all unanswered questions.  You can use this list to quickly navigate to any unanswered question.  This toolbar also contains the \"Done\" button.<br><br>When you have finished the test, you can click the \"Done\" button in the top toolbar or you can simply click the \"Next\" button below the drop down boxes one final time.  <br><br>",
