  "instructions": "<span role=heading aria-level=3 >DATA ENTRY/CALL SUMMARY & CHAT TEST</span><br /> <br />You are about to start the \"Data Entry/Call Summary & Chat\" test.  For this test, you will need to listen to information that is provided to you through the computer. We recommend using a headset or a set of quality speakers.<br /> <br />During this test you should listen to each telephone call and enter the caller’s data into the proper fields on the screen as it is given.  You can use the mouse to go to any field in the data-entry table.  You can also use the \"Tab\" or \"Enter\" keys to move to the next field, and the \"Shift\"-\"Tab\" combination to go back to the previous field.  Please note that the data presented during this test may not be in the same order as the fields on the screen.  For example, sometimes you will be given the phone number before you are given the caller’s name or address.<br /> <br />You do not need to enter the hyphens ( - ) for telephone numbers.  The hyphens have already been entered for you.<br /> <br />In addition, during each call you will be presented with a written \"chat\" message from a second person asking for help.  The message from the second person will appear in the chat window that is located on the bottom right corner of the screen.  <br /> <br />Each time a new \"chat\" message is presented you will hear a distinctive sound and the words \"Chat Message\" will flash at the top of the screen.  You will have a maximum of 20 seconds to respond to the chat message by choosing \"Sales/Purchase\", \"Service/Repair\", \"Literature/Catalog\", or \"Account/Billing\" in response to the \"chat\" message.  Make your selection by determining which type of automated response should be given to the customer.  You have the following four options to choose from:<br /> <br />Sales/Purchase – Inquiries about shipping, pricing, purchasing a product, or placing an order.<br />Service/Repair – Inquiries about defects, non-working products, or poor functionality of a product.  <br />Literature/Catalog – Inquiries about brochures, catalogs, flyers, and other requests for product information.<br />Account/Billing – Inquires about late charges, finance charges, monthly bills, or account status information.<br /> <br />Use the pull-down menu to choose your response and then click on the \"Send\" button once you have made your choice. <br /> <br />A \"Chat has ended\" acknowledgement will appear in the chat message box if you make your choice and click on the \"Send\" button within the 20-scond time limit. If you do not respond within 20 seconds, the \"Send\" button will be disabled, you will see \"Customer has ended chat\" and you will no longer be permitted to respond to that message.<br /> <br />Failing to respond to \"chat\" messages within 20 seconds each time one is presented will result in a lower score.<br /> <br />Then, after each call is completed, you will be presented with a question asking you to summarize the call you just heard.  For this task, you should choose the response that best represents the caller’s issue presented in the call.<br /> <br />After you have finished the question, click the \"Next\" button that will appear on the top-right corner of the screen to listen to the next call. <br /> <br />Finally, during this test the computer will automatically enter data in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  There is no need for you to adjust the keyboard since this will be done automatically. <br /> <br />Please note, although you may hear state names during the call, do not enter the state names, or state abbreviations, during this test.<p class='aria-only'>Press Alt+s to pause the background audio. Press Alt+r to resume the background audio.</p><br /> <br />Good luck!",
