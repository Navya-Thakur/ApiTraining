      "referenceText": "Dear Mrs. Karla Barcling,\n\nDo you wonder what your thousands of customers are thinking? Have you been plagued by gnawing concerns that your clients are not repeat purchasers of your goods or services? Has it crossed your mind that those who have bought from your company in the past are vocalizing their dissatisfaction with your company's service?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of the preceding 3 questions, then perhaps Targeted Results Surveys (TRS) are the answer to your concerns. TRS have been painstakingly developed by our staff of highly trained Industrial-Organizational Psychologists; well over 4/5ths of who have earned their PhDs. These customer satisfaction questionnaires have been piloted on samples of customers in the airline, manufacturing, cosmetology, medical, and plumbing industries. These TRS have been proven to be both highly valid and reliable measurement instruments. Perhaps you are wondering how these TRS work. It is really quite a simple procedure that is a) effective and b) time efficient. Basically, your organization simply collects customer information at the time of service/delivery. Client specifics are entered into a hand-held, computerized device called a BAPPAR, which is the size of a cell phone. This piece of technology immediately transmits the data back to our headquarters, where we compile the information. Then, our organization does in-depth research through our highly classified means to figure out which one of our 16 differently instructional letters will best encourage completion of the accompanying TRS. Pallanca Customer Service Consultancy (PCSC) handles the rest.\n\nYour marketing department will be provided with bi-weekly survey results. These findings will explicitly tell your organization what you are doing well, in addition to pinpointing areas in need of improvement. Each TRS summary will be delivered via email, allowing for ease of viewing, data mining, compilation, within-company distribution, and storage. Certainly, discriminating people like you may wish to view demos of our feedback mechanism at our award-winning website listed below. See for yourself just how user-friendly the electronic result format is. While you're at the site, be sure to read the testimonials. Ask yourself if your company can afford to lose customers due to problems that could easily be solved--if you only knew what those problems were. TRS can elucidate your problems and retain your customers.\n\nNot only can TRS increase your customer satisfaction, but they may also help you find new customers.  Out in-house experts have over hundreds of clients they have helped find new revenue.  There are thousands of new prospects in the current digital/electronic market.  From cell phone companies to microchip companies, there are countless opportunities for your company to gain revenue streams.  Let one of our experts help you to improve/grow your company.
